    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Groundbreaking and novel research is the pinnacle of scholarship and has been celebrated for millennia. Oftentimes, academics have posed controversial and unconventional solutions to problems and were ridiculed and humiliated only for their discoveries to revolutionize their field of study. The study of human health and migration are both not only controversial and sensitive subjects but are also politically charged. The links between migration and health are overwhelmingly complex and affect each other in various ways, and a new researcher must have ample knowledge of both fields in order to bridge them together. The health of both local and migrant populations can relate to each other through various stressors and finding these links.</p>
<p>Contemporarily, there are numerous refugee crisis’ in sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, South-East Asia, Latin America and Central America. Many of these refugees are fleeing ethnic cleansing, discrimination, and famine from their homelands and are vulnerable to the governing authority of their new location. The term ‘refugee’ is not a monolith and there are demographics among refugees that are especially vulnerable. These include individuals who identify within the LGBTQI community, against which many societies openly discriminate against. LGBTQI individuals may face violence, sexual assault, dehumanization, and humiliation in their location of origin and may experience continued oppression during their journeys as migrants. A researcher whose goal is to improve the wellbeing of that community by researching the barriers to access for healthcare for them then they should educate themselves to issues sensitive to the LGBTQI community and treat them with dignity and respect. Another type of vulnerable population are kids who are illegal immigrants on the USA - Mexico border. The treatment of the US government regarding children under its custody has been criticized to be cruel and inhumane. Many children, as young as two or three and up to adolescence do not speak English and are subject to legal proceedings for which they have no legal representation and which decide their future in the country. A researcher wanting to document the struggles of these children should think about the best manner in which to make them feel safe and find effective ways of lobbying the government to change their methods. In general, research for refugee migrants would require travel to the effected area and interaction with the target population. Ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity should be of utmost important because many migrants will be wary of exploitation should feel safe, especially around people who want to help them.</p>
<p>To conclude, migration and health are intricately connected and any future researchers should be careful to respect vulnerable populations. Migrants have faced varying levels of oppression and discrimination through history and this seems unlikely to change contemporarily and into the future. Scholars and academics are the drivers of progress and critical thought and need to be held at a high standard.</p>
