      <description>Since Covid-19 began, I started reading fiction again after negating it for essentially my entire undergraduate career. I started reading more Indian authors and some important works of the Indian Independence Movement which culminated in the sovreign Indian Republic in 1947.

      <description>Reading the Trovao and Nelson papers about the origin and spread of pandemic influenza strains whilst experiencing it firsthand (in the ‘comfort’ of my own home) was quite surreal; it’s rare to read an academic paper that has tangible influence over ones person life. I would like to discuss how developing countries can minimize the probability of incidence of zoonotic diseases. The Trovao paper discussed how modern swine agriculture combined with global trade make the associated influenza virus extremely difficult to deal with.</description>
