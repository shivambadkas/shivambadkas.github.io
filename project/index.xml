      <description>The University of San Diego keeps detailed records of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, USA. Anthropogenic climate change is the foremost important issue this century and must be met with a global internationally organized pushback. Records from the observatory allow us to graph the effect of international political incidents which may increase or decrease the burning of fossil fuels. The figures are graphed from the year 1970, from when observations began.</description>

      <description>The 2014 American National Youth Tobacco Survey provides national data on youthâ€™s (below 18) tobacco related beliefs and behaviours. The survey contains data for state, age, school, sex, rural/urban and ethnicity of secondary school students. The first goal of this analysis is to determine if the state the child lives in is more important than the specific school the child attends. The second goal is to determine whether two non-smoking children are equally as likely to try cigarettes the next month irrespective of age but provided that confounders of sex, rural/urban, and ethnicity and random effects of state and school are the same.</description>
