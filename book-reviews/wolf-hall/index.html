    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Wolf Hall - Hilary Mantel (2009)</p>
<p>The conflict at the heart of the novel hand is very simple, the king needed a male heir and his wife of 20 years Katherine was too old to have more children. His closest and highest ranking advisor, the Cardinal Thomas Wolsey fell out of favour due to his inability to procure the divorce from the Pope in the Vatican. Enter Thomas Cromwell, the Cardinal’s chief confidant and advisor, a pragmatic and practical lawyer born to a blacksmith (important to note his non-noble family) who gains Henry’s trust and becomes the de facto chief advisor to the king. Cromwell spent his years in continental Europe where he fought in French wars, apprenticed in Italian banking houses, and made his wealth trading fabrics in Belgium. His experience in these matters made him a much more competent royal advisor than the brash and arrogant noblemen who surrounded the king. The plot of the novel involves the revoking of Henry’s first marriage and his ambition into the second as well as the dissolution of the monasteries and the crowning of the prince as the head of the church in England.</p>
<p>Many people have gripes with this book because of the way Cromwell is described, Mantel uses the pronoun ‘he’ to refer to him instead of his name, a style that takes a little while to get accustomed to. This is a very good decision, the nobility of England do not respect due to his birth and his presence is always unassuming; he is non-existent until his skillset is needed. If it isn’t obvious who ‘he’ is referring to then it’s a safe bet to assume it is Cromwell, that was the rule of thumb I used.</p>
<p>This is one of the best books I’ve read, Mantel’s slick prose and dialogues are very memorable. She uses dream sequences and fables to enrich the story and provide motivations and contexts, and is also very liberal with her use of semicolons. I’ve never read anything with more semicolons but she does it very well. Cromwell’s admiration of his master the cardinal and his skill in persuading the king and handling his opponents at court has made Mantel’s rendition of him into one of my favourite characters. Unlike other renditions of Tudor England, Mantel’s Cromwell is a sympathetic figure aiming to secure his family’s fortunes and make a name for himself. Cromwell sees how the noblemen insult the Cardinal and beings his plan. It is not spelled out, you must read the next book to see the genius of the planning by both the character and the author.</p>
<p>The author put a lot of research into this book and it shows, but the writing is what really impressed me. I’ve read a lot of books and I know how difficult it must be to write quality sentences and paragraphs which flow so well together. Mantel did a masterclass in setting the scene, only what is important is described and new information is given by dialogue or new information, sometimes you only get to know of someones presence in a room when they speak up. Dense and maybe a little difficult for beginners, I think this book is a masterpiece and the author is a a genius.</p>
<p>Some quotes:</p>
<p>“What was England, before Wolsey? A little offshore island, poor and cold”</p>
<p>“No ruler in the history of the world has ever been able to afford a war. They&rsquo;re not affordable things. No prince ever says, &lsquo;This is my budget, so this is the kind of war I can have.”</p>
<p>“You can be merry with the king, you can share a joke with him. But as Thomas More used to say, it&rsquo;s like sporting with a tamed lion. You tousle its mane and pull its ears, but all the time you&rsquo;re thinking, those claws, those claws, those claws.”</p>
