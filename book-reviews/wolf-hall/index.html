    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Wolf Hall - Hilary Mantel (2009)</p>
<p>The conflict at the novel&rsquo;s heart is straightforward; the king needs a male heir, and his wife of 20 years, Katherine, is too old to have more children. His closest and highest ranking advisor, the Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, has fallen out of favour due to his inability to convince the Vatican to grant the divorce so Henry can legally remarry. Enter Thomas Cromwell, the Cardinal&rsquo;s chief advisor, a pragmatic and practical lawyer born to a blacksmith (important to note his non-noble family) who acts as the Cardinal&rsquo;s ambassador to the king. Cromwell spent his years in continental Europe, where he fought in French wars, worked in Florentine and Venetian banking houses, made a fortune trading fabrics in Antwerp, and trained as a lawyer in London. His varied experiences and skills make him a much more competent advisor than the brash and arrogant noblemen who usually surround the king. The novel&rsquo;s main plot follows Cromwell&rsquo;s meteoritic rise from the Cardinal&rsquo;s office to the king&rsquo;s inner council in the attempt to serve the king what he desires - his divorce. Media portrayals of Cromwell are usually negative, but Mantel shows him as a sympathetic family man and a loyal friend to the Cardinal. Through Mantels' slick prose, we see a fictionalized version of the events that led to the English Reformation.</p>
<p>Many readers have gripes with this book because of the confusion caused by Mantel&rsquo;s decision to use the pronoun &lsquo;he&rsquo; instead of Cromwell&rsquo;s name when invoking his character. The style takes a little while to get accustomed to, and at first, it is confusing who is talking - Cromwell or someone else? There are instances where all the men are named Thomas, and you have to do detective work to figure out who&rsquo;s saying what. If it isn&rsquo;t apparent who &lsquo;he&rsquo; is referring to, then it&rsquo;s a safe bet to assume it is Cromwell; that was the rule of thumb I used. Although using &lsquo;he&rsquo; instead of referring to Cromwell by name takes a while to get used to, I think it is an excellent choice stylistically. Not mentioning his name makes you feel that the character is unassuming and not present. He only speaks when he is spoken to at court and does not have many friends. Nobility does not see him as a man worthy of respect due to his low birth; he is always in the background until someone important needs him.</p>
<p>“You can be merry with the king, you can share a joke with him. But as Thomas More used to say, it&rsquo;s like sporting with a tamed lion. You tousle its mane and pull its ears, but all the time you&rsquo;re thinking, those claws, those claws, those claws.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Cromwell on More</li>
</ul>
<p>Wolf Hall is one of the best books I&rsquo;ve read, Mantel&rsquo;s prose is sublime, and her dialogues are very memorable. She creatively uses devices such as dream sequences and fables to enrich the story and provide motivations and contexts and is also very liberal with her use of semicolons. I&rsquo;ve never read anything with more semicolons, but she does it very well and in a manner that makes you appreciate her skill. The book encompasses the period from the fall of the Cardinal to the marriage of Anne Boleyn and Henry Tudor. During the fall of the Cardinal from the king&rsquo;s grace, Cromwell sees how the noblemen insult the Cardinal and begins his plan for revenge, a plan unwritten but realized in the sequel. I also really liked how Henry Tudor and Anne Boleyn were portrayed. In the beginning, when Cromwell works for the Cardinal, the king&rsquo;s name evokes awe and splendour, but the closer Cromwell gets to him, the more you see he&rsquo;s just a man who can&rsquo;t handle his power and cannot keep his friends. Cromwell&rsquo;s dealings with Anne Boleyn are also very memorable for their humour and wit.</p>
<p>“What was England, before Wolsey? A little offshore island, poor and cold”</p>
<ul>
<li>On Wolsey&rsquo;s death</li>
</ul>
<p>Another plot point is that of England&rsquo;s schism with the Vatican. Historically, Cromwell was instrumental in crowning the Prince as the head of the Church in England. Under Henry&rsquo;s reign, the monasteries were dissolved, and their revenues were rerouted to the king. Cromwell was a progressive when the Crown was burning people alive for heresy. We see the legal and religious arguments between the Crown, headed by Cromwell, and Thomas More, a powerful nobleman who oppressed the Protestant Revolution and was Cromwell&rsquo;s primary opponent at court. The book ends with the execution of Thomas More.</p>
<p>I read this novel many years ago, and it made me realize that a text&rsquo;s subject matter does not matter, only how it is written. The plot was interesting, but it seemed like it was moving at a snail&rsquo;s pace. It seemed as though events took forever to occur, and when they did, they panned out very slowly, and towards the end of the book, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the central climax was - Henry&rsquo;s wedding or More&rsquo;s execution. It was the journey rather than the destination with this book. Reading about the ins and outs of Cromwell&rsquo;s daily life, his conversations with his family, friends, coworkers, household staff, and noblemen made a fully-fledged character that I think most readers would grow close to, and I sure did.</p>
<p>The author put a lot of research into this book, and it shows, but the writing is what impressed me. I&rsquo;ve read many books and understand how difficult it must be to write quality sentences and paragraphs that flow well together. Mantel showed a masterclass in setting the scene; I liked how only what is essential is described, and new information is given as you need it through dialogue or exposition. Sometimes, you only know someone&rsquo;s presence in a room when they say something. Dense and maybe a little difficult for beginners, I think this book is a masterpiece and Mantel is a genius.</p>
