    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Wolf Hall - Hilary Mantel (2009)</p>
<p>The conflict at the heart of the novel hand is very simple, the king needs a male heir and his wife of 20 years, Katherine, is too old to have more children. His closest and highest ranking advisor, the Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, has fallen out of favour due to his inability to convince the Vatican to grant the divorce so Henry can legally remarry. Enter Thomas Cromwell, the Cardinal’s chief advisor, a pragmatic and practical lawyer born to a blacksmith (important to note his non-noble family) who acts as the Cardinal&rsquo;s ambassador to the king. Cromwell spent his years in continental Europe where he fought in French wars, worked in Florentine and Ventian banking houses, made a fortune trading fabrics in Antwerp, and trained as a lawyer in London. His varied experiences and wide repertoire of skills makes him a much more competent advisor than the brash and arrogant noblemen who usually surround the king. The main plot of the novel follows Cromwell&rsquo;s meteorotic rise from the Cardinal&rsquo;s office to the kings inner council in the attempt to serve the king what he desires - his divorce. Media portrayals of Cromwell are usually negative but Mantel shows him as a sympathetic family man and a loyal friend to the Cardinal. Through Mantels&rsquo;s slick prose see a fictionalized version of the events that lead to the English Reformation.</p>
<p>Many readers have gripes with this book because of the confusion caused by Mantel&rsquo;s decision to use the pronoun &lsquo;he&rsquo; instead of Cromwell&rsquo;s name when invoking his character. The style takes a little while to get accustomed to and at first it is confusing as to who is talking - Cromwell or someone else? There are instances where all the men are named Thomas and you have to do some detective work to figure out who&rsquo;s saying what. If it isn’t obvious who ‘he’ is referring to then it’s a safe bet to assume it is Cromwell, that was the rule of thumb I used. Although using &lsquo;he&rsquo; instead of referring to Cromwell by name takes a while to get used to, I think it is a very good choice stylistically. By not mentioning his name, you get the feeling that the character is unassuming and not-present, he only speaks when he is spoken to at court and does not have many friends. Nobility did not see him as a man worthy of respect due to his low birth, he is always in the background until someone important needs him.</p>
<p>This is one of the best books I’ve read, Mantel’s prose is sublime and her dialogues are very memorable. She creatively uses various devices such as dream sequences and fables to enrich the story and provide motivations and contexts, and is also very liberal with her use of semicolons.  I’ve never read anything with more semicolons but she does it very well and in a manner that makes you appreciate her skill. During the fall of the Cardinal from the king&rsquo;s grace, Cromwell sees how the noblemen insult the Cardinal and begins his plan for revenge, a plan unspelled but realized in the sequel to this book. I also really liked the manner in which Henry Tudor and Anne Boleyn were also very well portrayed. At the beginning when Cromwell works for the Cardinal, the king&rsquo;s name evokes awe and splendour, but the closer Cromwell got to him the more you see he&rsquo;s just a man who can&rsquo;t handle his power and cannot keep his friends. Cromwells dealings with Anne Boleyn are also very memorable for their humour and wit. The book encompasses the time period of the fall of the Cardinal to the marriage of Anne Boleyn and Henry Tudor.</p>
<p>Another plot point is that of England&rsquo;s divorce from the Vatican. Cromwell was instrumental in crowning the Prince as the head of the Church in England. Under Henry&rsquo;s reign, the monasteries were dissolved and their revenues rerouted to the King. Cromwell was a progressive at a time where the Crown was burning people alive for heresy. We see the legal and religious arguements between the Crown, headed by Cromwell, and Thomas More, a powerful nobleman who oppressed the Protestant Revolution and was Cromwell&rsquo;s main opponents at court. The book ends with the execution of Thomas More.</p>
<p>I read this novel many years ago and it made me realize that the subject matter of the text does not matter, only how it is written. The plot was interesting but it seemed as though it was moving at a snails pace. It seemed as though events took forever to occur and when they did they panned out very slowly, and towards the end of the book I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the main climax was - Henry&rsquo;s wedding or More&rsquo;s execution. It really was the journey rather than the destination with this book. Reading about the in&rsquo;s and out&rsquo;s of Cromwell&rsquo;s daily life, his conversations with his family, friends, coworkers, household staff, and noblemen made a fully fledged character that I think most readers would grow close to, I sure did.</p>
<p>The author put a lot of research into this book and it shows, but the writing is what really impressed me. I’ve read a lot of books and I know how difficult it must be to write quality sentences and paragraphs that flow well together. Mantel showed a masterclass in setting the scene, I liked how only what is important is described and new information is given as you need it through dialogue or exposition, sometimes you only get to know of someones presence in a room when they speak up. Dense and maybe a little difficult for beginners, I think this book is a masterpiece and the author is a a genius.</p>
<p>Some quotes:</p>
<p>“What was England, before Wolsey? A little offshore island, poor and cold”</p>
<p>“No ruler in the history of the world has ever been able to afford a war. They&rsquo;re not affordable things. No prince ever says, &lsquo;This is my budget, so this is the kind of war I can have.”</p>
<p>“You can be merry with the king, you can share a joke with him. But as Thomas More used to say, it&rsquo;s like sporting with a tamed lion. You tousle its mane and pull its ears, but all the time you&rsquo;re thinking, those claws, those claws, those claws.”</p>
