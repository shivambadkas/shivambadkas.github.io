    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Shalimar the Clown is British-Indian author Salman Rushdie’s eighth novel, a globe trotting magical realism tragedy that reads like a thriller. The title ‘Shalimar’ comes from the famous Indian dynasty Mughal gardens of Kashmir, also the name of a character. As with many Rushdie stories, the characters themselves represent themes that Rushdie has given them, and their lives are mirrors of the history in which they live in. Rushdie generally incorporates Hindu allegory into his novels, as well as various aspects of South Asian culture and history.</p>
<p>The centre of the story is India, a young woman who is the American ambassador’s daughter from his paramour, Booyni, a Kashmiri dancer from a quiet village who seduced the ambassador whilst dancing as Anarkali. The play Anarkali is an apocryphal story, in it the Emperor Akbar’s son is enamoured by the court dancer Anarkali and shuns his duties and wages war with his father in order to have her. Similarly, the ambassador and Boonyi shun their professional and personal duties to have each other, and in doing so change the course of their lives.</p>
<p>‘A plague on both your houses’ Rushdie quotes Romeo and Juliet in the foreword, an ample foreshadowing of both his work and the story of Kashmir. Kashmir was not always mired by sectarian violence. Rushdie recalls the history of the valley and stories of its princes and folk heroes, injecting and invoking them at his will. The friendship of two village leaders blossoms into the love of their children for each other, and in a grand show of solidarity and acceptance the interfaith love of Hindu Boonyi and Muslim Shalimar is celebrated by the village-folk. It is torn apart by her ambition to leave the valley and rise above her peers into the greater world, resulting in her betrayal of her Shalimar The plot is constructed on the fracturing of Boonyi and Shalimars relationship, representing the fracturing of the relationship between Kashmir’s Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>Rushdie adopts a strict anti-military and anti-militant stance, both the militants and military are portrayed in a negative manner, their presence and actions being the root of discord in the valley. For example, at the beginning of the book, an Indian general is posted in Kashmir, hoping for quick glory and a better posting. Towards the end, his long tenure and his cruelty towards his enemies leaves him a shell of a man, meeting his demise by a curse laid upon him by a villager.</p>
<p>The prose of the novel is very slick and cool, Rushdie creates sublime sentences and uses fables and allegories heavily in his works. His vocabulary is large and although not very dense it is not an easy read. An epic tale of romance and revenge spanning the range of Kashmir to Vichy France all the way to Mullholland Drive, this novel explores the way war, faith, and ambition can alter destinies.</p>
