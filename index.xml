      <description>Hello and welcome! I am a recent graduate of the University of Toronto where I double majored in Statistics and Global Health and minored in Mathematics. A major theme of my education was the way in which climate change would affect human populations around the globe. I am interested in using statistics and data science to highlight the different ways in which climate change will affect the health of human populations around the globe.</description>
